# Chemicals In Cosmetics
# Background
Do you ever wonder what ingredients are in your favorite cosmetics? There are over 12,000 chemicals used in cosmetics and personal care products. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com. The California Safe Cosmetics Program in the California Department of Public Health has made information available on these hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in the state. Under the California Safe Cosmetics Act, manufacturers, packers, and/or distributors named on the product label are required to report a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients which may cause cancer, birth defects, or issues related to development and reproduction.

# Data
Raw data about the cosmetic companies that have reported hazardous ingredients in their products is aggregated by the CDPH and made available by HealthData.gov. I cleaned and analyzed it using PostgreSQL.
